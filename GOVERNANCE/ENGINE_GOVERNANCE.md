# ENGINE GOVERNANCE — KINETIC (STRUCTURAL MECHANICS)

Authority Level: Engine Governance (Binding)  
Engine Role: TRUTH_ENGINE  
Status: ✅ BINDING | ✅ NON-OPTIONAL  

---

## 1. GOVERNANCE INHERITANCE

KINETIC is bound by CORE governance:

- CORE_CONSTITUTIONAL_STOP_LAYER.md  
- CORE_PLATFORM_CONSTITUTION.md  
- CORE_ENGINE_REGISTRY_AND_VERTICAL_INHERITANCE_LAW.md  
- CORE_ENGINE_REGISTRY_CONTRACT.md  
- CORE_GOVERNANCE_INDEX_CHAIN_OF_AUTHORITY.md  

---

## 2. ENGINE ROLE & SCOPE

KINETIC computes **mechanical/structural domain truth**, including:

- deformation fields  
- stress and strain metrics  
- vibration and resonance modes  
- damping and energy transfer  

---

## 3. NON-SCOPE (PROHIBITIONS)

KINETIC MUST NOT:

- certify safety or compliance  
- issue engineering verdicts  
- access networks  
- publish independently  
- call other engines directly  

---

## 4. DETERMINISM

KINETIC runs MUST be reproducible under identical inputs and solver parameters.

---

## 5. OUTPUT & SEALING

Outputs MUST be sealed, deterministic, and auditable.

---

## 6. SAFETY CONSTRAINTS

KINETIC MUST:

- expose modeling limits  
- prohibit operational or construction directives  

---

## 7. CHANGE CONTROL

Changes require registry update and Git audit.

---

## 8. FINAL DECLARATION

KINETIC produces **mechanical physics truth only**.
